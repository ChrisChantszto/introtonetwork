#### How to Use the CMD Program

Once the CMD program is running, it will prompt you for input. You can enter one of the following options to perform network monitoring:

1. `HTTP`
2. `HTTPS`
3. `ICMP`
4. `DNS`
5. `NTP`
6. `TCP`
7. `UDP`
8. `ECHO` - This starts an echo server (Please use `127.0.0.1` and port number `12345` for testing purposes only).

Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the monitoring.

To exit the program, type `Exit`.

To begin network monitoring, type `begin`.
